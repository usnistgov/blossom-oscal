            User access to the system and privileges are enforced by assignment to groups within the Active Directory domain. Authorized access will be permitted for system administrators to:
            (a) Establish system accounts, configure access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configure settings for events to be audited, and establish intrusion detection parameters; and
            (b) Review access control lists.
