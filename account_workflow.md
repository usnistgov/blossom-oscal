# Account Management Workflow
Document that explains the workflow of GitHub actions used to automate account management.

The requester creates a new GitHub issue (Account Request Form) to request an account for the Account Holder.
The Blossom Management group is automatically notified to review this request through GitHub.
A Blossom Management member reviews the request and adds a new label to the issue: ACCOUNT_APPROVED or ACCOUNT_REJECTED
If ACCOUNT_APPROVED, the Blossom Sysdevs group is automatically notified to implement the account and submit a new issue (Account Management Authorization Form) for the Account Holder.
If ACCOUNT_REJECTED, the account request issue is automatically closed.
